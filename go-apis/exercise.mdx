title: "Exercise 5: Todos API"
---

In this exercise, you'll implement a complete Todo application REST API using Gin and SQLite. This will help you apply everything you've learned so far about building APIs with Gin.

## Requirements

Build a Todo API with the following features:

1. **Data Storage**: 
   - Use SQLite3 as a database (not in-memory data structures)
   - Use GORM as the ORM to interact with the database

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Create a new todo
   - Get all todos
   - Get a specific todo by ID
   - Update a todo
   - Delete a todo
   - Mark a todo as completed

3. **User Authentication**:
   - Register new users
   - Login and return JWT tokens
   - Protect todo routes with authentication

4. **Middleware**:
   - Implement logging middleware
   - Implement authentication middleware

5. **Project Structure**:
   - Split your code into multiple files for better organization
   - Use proper error handling
   - Follow REST best practices

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Go module:
   ```bash
   mkdir todo-api
   cd todo-api
   go mod init todo-api
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
   go get -u gorm.io/gorm
   go get -u gorm.io/driver/sqlite
   go get -u github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4
   go get -u golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt
   ```

3. Structure your project with these files:
   - `main.go` - The entry point of your application
   - `models/` - Directory for your database models
   - `handlers/` - Directory for your API handlers
   - `middleware/` - Directory for middleware components
   - `routes/` - Directory for route definitions
   - `db/` - Directory for database setup

## Bonus Challenges

If you finish the main requirements, try these additional challenges:

1. Add pagination for the "get all todos" endpoint
2. Implement filtering by completion status
3. Add due dates to todos and allow sorting by due date
4. Add the ability to organize todos with labels or categories

Good luck! Use the concepts we've covered in previous chapters to build a clean, well-structured API.
