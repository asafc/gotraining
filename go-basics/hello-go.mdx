## Introduction
Welcome to Go programming! Go (or as it is sometimes called - GoLang) is a fun and efficient language designed for simplicity, readability, and performance. If you already know Python, you'll find Go's straightforward syntax and powerful features a natural next step in your programming journey.

In this first chapter, we'll write our first Go program, understand its basic structure, and learn how to compile and run it.

## Your First Go Program

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program. Create a file named `hello.go` with the following content:

```go
// Every Go file must belong to a package
package main

// Import statements bring in code from other packages
import "fmt"

// The main function is the entry point of the program
func main() {
    // Println writes a line to standard output
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

This small program demonstrates several important concepts in Go. Let's break it down:

### Understanding the Syntax

1. **Package Declaration**: `package main`
   - Every Go file starts with a package declaration
   - The `main` package is special - it defines an executable program rather than a library
   - Go programs start running in the `main` package's `main` function
   - There can only be one main package in a compiled Go executable
   - If you're creating a library instead of an executable, you would use a different package name and would not have a main function

2. **Import Statement**: `import "fmt"`
   - The `import` keyword brings in external packages
   - `fmt` is a standard library package for formatted I/O operations (similar to Python's print functions)

3. **Main Function**: `func main() { ... }`
   - `func` keyword is used to declare a function
   - The `main()` function is the entry point of the program
   - When you run a Go program, execution starts at the `main()` function

4. **Function Call**: `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`
   - Calls the `Println` function from the `fmt` package
   - This function prints the text and adds a newline (similar to `print()` in Python)

## Using the Go Command Line Tool

Go comes with a powerful command-line tool, simply called `go`. Here are some basic commands you'll need:

### Running Go Programs

You can run a Go program directly with:

```bash
go run hello.go
```

This command compiles and executes the program in one step. It's perfect for development and testing.

### Building an Executable

To compile your code into an executable file:

```bash
go build hello.go
```

This creates an executable file named `hello` (or `hello.exe` on Windows). You can then run this executable:

```bash
# On Linux/Mac
./hello

# On Windows
hello.exe
```

Building an executable is useful when you want to distribute your program or run it without the Go tools installed.

### Formatting Go Code

One of Go's distinctive features is its standardized code formatting. Unlike many other languages where formatting is subjective, Go has an officially endorsed format enforced by the `go fmt` command:

```bash
go fmt hello.go
```

This command automatically reformats your code to follow Go's standard style. Some key aspects of this standard format include:

- Tabs for indentation (not spaces)
- Line length suggestions
- Standardized placement of braces
- Consistent spacing rules

The Go community strongly embraces this convention, and it's considered good practice to run `go fmt` on your code before sharing it. Many Go developers configure their editors to run this command automatically on save.

This "one way to format" philosophy has several benefits:
- Eliminates style debates in teams
- Makes all Go code look familiar, even from different authors
- Improves readability across the Go ecosystem

For larger projects, you might also use:

```bash
go fmt ./...
```

This formats all Go files in the current directory and subdirectories.

### Starting a New Go Project

To initialize a new Go project:

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
go mod init my_project
```

This creates a basic Go module, which we'll explore more in later chapters. For now, you can think of it as setting up the foundation for your Go project.

## Complete Example

Let's expand our example slightly to show a bit more of Go's features:

```go
package main

// Import multiple packages using parentheses
import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // := is a shorthand for declaring and 
    // initializing variables in the same statement
    name := "Gopher"
    
    // Use the time package to get the current time
    currentTime := time.Now()
    
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")

    // Printf allows formatted output similar to Python's f-strings
    fmt.Printf(
        "Hello, %s! The current time is %s\n",
        name,
        currentTime.Format("15:04:05"))
}
```

This program introduces:
- Multiple imports in parentheses
- Variables with type inference (`:=`)
- String formatting with `Printf` (similar to Python's f-strings)
- Using a package function (`time.Now()`)

## Try It Yourself!

Congratulations on writing your first Go program! Go ahead and try running it using both the `go run` and `go build` commands.

Experiment with changing the message, adding more `fmt.Println()` statements, or creating your own variables.

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into Go's variables, types, and basic operations. By the end of this course, you'll be comfortable building real-world applications in Go!

Remember, Go was designed to be easy to learn while being incredibly powerful. Its simplicity and performance make it both fun to write and efficient to run - the best of both worlds!
