title: Flow Control
description: for, if, else, switch and defer
---

In this chapter, we'll explore Go's flow control structures that allow you to control the execution path of your program. These include loops, conditional statements, and ways to defer execution of functions.

## For Loops

Go has only one looping construct, the `for` loop. It can be used in several different ways.

### Standard For Loop

The most common form of the `for` loop has three components:
- an initialization statement
- a condition expression
- a post statement

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Standard for loop with init, condition, and post statements
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("Value of i:", i)
    }
}
```

The loop executes as follows:
1. The initialization statement (`i := 0`) runs once before the first iteration
2. Before each iteration, the condition (`i < 5`) is evaluated
3. After each iteration, the post statement (`i++`) executes
4. The loop terminates when the condition evaluates to `false`

### For Loop as a While Loop

The initialization and post statements are optional. By omitting them, you can use the `for` loop as a "while" loop:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    sum := 1
    
    // For loop as a while loop
    for sum < 100 {
        sum += sum
        fmt.Println("Current sum:", sum)
    }
    fmt.Println("Final sum:", sum)
}
```

### Infinite Loop

If you omit the condition as well, you create an infinite loop that will run forever (unless you break out of it):

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    counter := 0
    
    // Infinite loop (while true)
    for {
        fmt.Println("Iteration:", counter)
        counter++
        
        // Break out after 5 iterations
        if counter >= 5 {
            fmt.Println("Breaking out of the infinite loop")
            break
        }
        
        // Small delay to avoid printing too fast
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
```

### For Loop with Range

The `range` form of the `for` loop iterates over elements in various data structures:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Define a slice of strings
    languages := []string{"Python", "Go", "Java", "C++"}
    
    // Iterate over a slice with range
    for index, value := range languages {
        fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %s\n", index, value)
    }
    
    // If you only need the index
    for i := range languages {
        fmt.Printf("Language at index %d: %s\n", i, languages[i])
    }
    
    // If you only need the value, use _ to ignore the index
    for _, language := range languages {
        fmt.Printf("Language: %s\n", language)
    }
}
```

## Conditional Statements

### If Statement

The `if` statement in Go is similar to other languages but doesn't require parentheses around the condition:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := 10
    
    // Basic if statement
    if x > 5 {
        fmt.Println("x is greater than 5")
    }
}
```

### If with a Short Statement

The `if` statement can start with a short statement before the condition.

Variables declared in the short statement are only available within the scope of the `if` statement (including the `else` blocks).

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // If with a short statement
    if x := 42; x > 20 {
        fmt.Println("x is greater than 20")
    }
    
    // Note: x is not accessible here
    // fmt.Println(x) would cause a compilation error
}
```

### If-Else Statement

You can use `else` and `else if` to handle multiple conditions:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    score := 85
    
    if score >= 90 {
        fmt.Println("Grade: A")
    } else if score >= 80 {
        fmt.Println("Grade: B")
    } else if score >= 70 {
        fmt.Println("Grade: C")
    } else if score >= 60 {
        fmt.Println("Grade: D")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Grade: F")
    }
}
```

## Switch Statement

Go's `switch` statement is a cleaner way to write long chains of `if-else` statements:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    day := "Tuesday"
    
    // Basic switch statement
    switch day {
    case "Monday":
        fmt.Println("Start of the work week")
    case "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday":
        fmt.Println("Middle of the work week")
    case "Friday":
        fmt.Println("End of the work week")
    default:
        fmt.Println("It's the weekend!")
    }
}
```

**In Go, switch cases don't "fall through" by default.** Once a case is matched, the switch terminates. You don't need to include `break` statements.

### Switch with Short Statement

Like `if`, a `switch` can include a short statement before the expression:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func main() {
    // Switch with a short statement
    switch today := time.Now().Weekday(); today {
    case time.Saturday, time.Sunday:
        fmt.Println("It's the weekend!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("It's a weekday.")
    }
}
```

### Switch with No Condition

A `switch` without a condition is the same as `switch true`, which makes it a cleaner way to write long if-else chains:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func main() {
    hour := time.Now().Hour()
    
    // Switch with no condition
    switch {
    case hour < 12:
        fmt.Println("Good morning!")
    case hour < 17:
        fmt.Println("Good afternoon!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Good evening!")
    }
}
```

## Defer Statement

The `defer` statement delays the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // The deferred call will execute at the end of main()
    defer fmt.Println("This prints last")
    
    fmt.Println("This prints first")
    fmt.Println("This prints second")
}
```

Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

### Stacking Defers

Multiple `defer` statements execute in LIFO (last-in-first-out) order:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Counting...")
    
    // These deferred statements will execute in reverse order
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        defer fmt.Println(i)
    }
    
    fmt.Println("Done counting!")
}
```

### Practical Use of Defer

A common use of `defer` is to ensure resources are cleaned up properly, regardless of how a function exits.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // Open a file
    f, err := os.Create("test.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error creating file:", err)
        return
    }
    
    // Schedule the file to be closed when main() exits
    defer f.Close()
    
    // Write to the file
    _, err = f.WriteString("Hello, Go!")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error writing to file:", err)
        return
    }
    
    fmt.Println("File operations completed successfully")
    // f.Close() will be called here, even if an error occurred above
}
```

This is better than the common pattern in other languages, because it makes you rememeber that as soon as you create a resource
that consumes memory, disk, etc you can clean it up immediately but scheduling it with defer. Therefore you won't leave dangling
resources around that will introduce leaks.

## Complete Flow Control Example

Let's put everything together in a complete example that demonstrates various flow control structures:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Demonstrate defer stacking
    defer fmt.Println("Program execution completed")
    defer fmt.Println("===== End of Program =====")
    
    fmt.Println("===== Flow Control in Go =====")
    
    // For loop examples
    fmt.Println("\n--- For Loop Examples ---")
    
    // Standard for loop
    fmt.Println("Standard for loop:")
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        fmt.Printf("  Iteration %d\n", i)
    }
    
    // While-style loop
    fmt.Println("\nWhile-style loop:")
    counter := 0
    for counter < 3 {
        fmt.Printf("  Counter: %d\n", counter)
        counter++
    }
    
    // Infinite loop with break
    fmt.Println("\nInfinite loop with break:")
    iterations := 0
    for {
        fmt.Printf("  Iteration %d\n", iterations)
        iterations++
        if iterations >= 3 {
            break
        }
    }
    
    // For-range loop
    fmt.Println("\nFor-range loop:")
    cities := []string{"New York", "London", "Tokyo"}
    for index, city := range cities {
        fmt.Printf("  City %d: %s\n", index, city)
    }
    
    // Conditional examples
    fmt.Println("\n--- Conditional Examples ---")
    
    // If-else chain
    fmt.Println("If-else example:")
    temperature := 75
    if temperature < 32 {
        fmt.Println("  It's freezing!")
    } else if temperature < 60 {
        fmt.Println("  It's cool.")
    } else if temperature < 90 {
        fmt.Println("  It's warm.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("  It's hot!")
    }
    
    // Switch statement
    fmt.Println("\nSwitch example:")
    switch day := time.Now().Weekday().String(); day {
    case "Saturday", "Sunday":
        fmt.Println("  It's the weekend!")
    case "Friday":
        fmt.Println("  It's almost the weekend!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("  It's a weekday:", day)
    }
    
    // Switch with no condition
    fmt.Println("\nSwitch with no condition:")
    hour := time.Now().Hour()
    switch {
    case hour < 12:
        fmt.Println("  Good morning!")
    case hour < 17:
        fmt.Println("  Good afternoon!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("  Good evening!")
    }
    
    // Defer example
    fmt.Println("\n--- Defer Examples ---")
    fmt.Println("Deferred function calls will execute after this")
    
    // The deferred prints will execute in reverse order (LIFO)
    defer fmt.Println("  Deferred message 3")
    defer fmt.Println("  Deferred message 2")
    defer fmt.Println("  Deferred message 1")
}
```

The above program demonstrates all the flow control structures we've covered in this chapter. Running it will show how each one works and in what order the deferred functions execute.

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned:

- Different forms of the `for` loop (standard, while-style, infinite, and range loops)
- How to use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for conditional execution
- The `switch` statement for cleaner alternatives to long if-else chains
- How to use `defer` to delay execution of a function until the surrounding function returns
- How deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order

These flow control structures are fundamental to writing effective Go programs and will be used extensively in the chapters that follow.
