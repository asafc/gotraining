title: Packages and Imports
description: "Learn how to organize your Go code with packages, import dependencies, understand exported names, and work with third-party libraries"

Now that you understand the basic syntax, functions, and variables in Go, it's time to learn how to organize your code into packages and import functionality from other packages. This chapter will explore Go's package system, which is a fundamental aspect of writing maintainable and scalable Go applications.

## Understanding Go Packages

In Go, a package is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together. Every Go source file belongs to a package, which is declared at the top of the file using the `package` keyword.

### Package Conventions

Here are some important conventions for Go packages:

1. **Package Names**: Should be short, concise, and descriptive
   - Use lowercase, single-word names
   - Avoid underscores or mixedCaps
   - The package name is often the same as the last element of the import path

2. **Package Organization**: 
   - One directory = one package (all files in a directory **must** have the same package name, otherwise the build will fail)
   - Subdirectories = separate packages

3. **Special Packages**:
   - `main`: Indicates an executable program; must have a `main()` function
   - `internal`: Contains code that can only be imported by its parent package or sibling packages

Let's look at a simple example of a project structure:

```
myproject/
├── main.go              // package main
├── calculator/
│   ├── basic.go         // package calculator
│   └── advanced.go      // package calculator
└── utils/
    └── formatter.go     // package utils
```

## Creating and Using Local Packages

Let's create a simple project with multiple packages to demonstrate how to organize and import local packages.

### Project Setup

First, let's initialize a new Go module:

```bash
mkdir mathapp
cd mathapp
go mod init mathapp
```

This creates a `go.mod` file that defines your module and its dependencies.

### Creating Package Files

Now, let's create the directory structure and files:

1. First, create a `calculator` directory and add a file called `calculator.go`:

```bash
mkdir calculator
```

**File: calculator/calculator.go**
```go
// Package calculator provides mathematical calculation functions
package calculator

// Add returns the sum of two integers
func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// Subtract returns the difference between two integers
func Subtract(a, b int) int {
    return a - b
}

// multiply is an unexported function (private to the package)
func multiply(a, b int) int {
    return a * b
}

// Multiply uses the private multiply function but is exported
func Multiply(a, b int) int {
    return multiply(a, b) // Using private function
}
```

2. Now, create the main application file:

**File: main.go**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    
    // Import local package using module path
    "mathapp/calculator"
)

func main() {
    // Using exported functions from the calculator package
    sum := calculator.Add(5, 3)
    difference := calculator.Subtract(10, 4)
    product := calculator.Multiply(6, 7)
    
    fmt.Println("Sum:", sum)
    fmt.Println("Difference:", difference)
    fmt.Println("Product:", product)
    
    // This would cause a compilation error:
    // calculator.multiply(2, 3) // Cannot access unexported function
}
```

### Building and Running

You can build and run this multi-package program just like any other Go application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Expected output:
```
Sum: 8
Difference: 6
Product: 42
```

## Exported Names and Visibility

Go has a simple rule for determining what is accessible outside a package (exported) and what is not (unexported):

- If a name (variable, type, function, etc.) starts with an **uppercase** letter, it's exported, meaning it's public and can be used by other packages
- If a name starts with a **lowercase** letter, it's unexported (**private** to the package in which it's defined)

<Note>
This naming convention **replaces** the `public` and `private` keywords found in many other languages. 

**There are no such keywords in Go.**
</Note>

### Examples of Exported and Unexported Names

```go
package example

// Exported (public)
var ExportedVariable = 42
func ExportedFunction() {}
type ExportedType struct {}

// Unexported (private)
var unexportedVariable = 21
func unexportedFunction() {}
type unexportedType struct {}
```

From outside the package, only the exported names are accessible:

```go
// In another package:
import "mymodule/example"

func main() {
    // Works fine:
    fmt.Println(example.ExportedVariable)
    example.ExportedFunction()
    var t example.ExportedType
    
    // Compilation errors - these names are not exported:
    // fmt.Println(example.unexportedVariable)
    // example.unexportedFunction()
    // var t example.unexportedType
}
```

## Using Third-Party Packages

One of Go's strengths is its ecosystem of third-party packages. Let's look at how to use a popular package from GitHub.

### Adding a Dependency

For this example, we'll use a popular string manipulation library called `go-stringutil`:

```bash
go get github.com/golang/example/stringutil
```

This command:
1. Downloads the package from GitHub
2. Adds the dependency to your `go.mod` file

### Using the Package

Now let's update our `main.go` file to use this third-party package:

**File: main.go**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    
    "mathapp/calculator"
    
    // Import third-party package
    "github.com/golang/example/stringutil"
)

func main() {
    // Using our local package
    sum := calculator.Add(5, 3)
    difference := calculator.Subtract(10, 4)
    product := calculator.Multiply(6, 7)
    
    fmt.Println("Sum:", sum)
    fmt.Println("Difference:", difference)
    fmt.Println("Product:", product)
    
    // Using the third-party package
    reversed := stringutil.Reverse("Hello, Go!")
    fmt.Println("Reversed string:", reversed)
}
```

### Running with Third-Party Dependencies

Run the program as usual:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Expected output:
```
Sum: 8
Difference: 6
Product: 42
Reversed string: !oG ,olleH
```

I'll revise the chapter to make the "Complete Example" section simpler by removing content that relies on structs and function receivers, which haven't been covered yet. Here's how I would modify that section:

## Complete Example: A Multi-Package Application

Let's create a simpler example with multiple packages that doesn't rely on structs or function receivers. We'll build a basic calculator application with separate packages for different types of operations:

### Project Structure

```
calcsystem/
├── go.mod
├── main.go
├── basic/
│   └── basic.go
├── advanced/
│   └── advanced.go
└── formatter/
    └── formatter.go
```

### Implementation

**File: go.mod**
```
module calcsystem

go 1.21
```

**File: basic/basic.go**
```go
package basic

// Add returns the sum of two integers
func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// Subtract returns the difference between two integers
func Subtract(a, b int) int {
    return a - b
}

// multiply is an unexported function (private to the package)
func multiply(a, b int) int {
    return a * b
}

// Multiply provides access to the unexported multiply function
func Multiply(a, b int) int {
    return multiply(a, b)
}
```

**File: advanced/advanced.go**
```go
package advanced

import "math"

// Power returns a raised to the power of b
func Power(a, b float64) float64 {
    return math.Pow(a, b)
}

// SquareRoot returns the square root of a number
func SquareRoot(a float64) float64 {
    return math.Sqrt(a)
}

// isNegative is an unexported function that checks if a number is negative
func isNegative(a float64) bool {
    return a < 0
}

// AbsoluteValue returns the absolute value of a number
func AbsoluteValue(a float64) float64 {
    if isNegative(a) {
        return -a
    }
    return a
}
```

**File: formatter/formatter.go**
```go
package formatter

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

// FormatResult formats a calculation result for display
func FormatResult(operation string, result float64) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Result of %s: %.2f", operation, result)
}

// FormatResults takes a list of result strings and formats them for display
func FormatResults(results []string) string {
    return strings.Join(results, "\n")
}
```

**File: main.go**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    
    "calcsystem/basic"
    "calcsystem/advanced"
    "calcsystem/formatter"
)

func main() {
    // Use the basic package
    sum := basic.Add(5, 3)
    difference := basic.Subtract(10, 4)
    product := basic.Multiply(6, 7)
    
    // Use the advanced package
    squared := advanced.Power(4, 2)
    squareRoot := advanced.SquareRoot(16)
    absValue := advanced.AbsoluteValue(-42)
    
    // Format and display results
    fmt.Println("CALCULATOR RESULTS")
    fmt.Println()
    
    // don't stress about not learning about string arrays yet,
    // we will introduce them in a future chapter.
    results := []string{
        formatter.FormatResult("addition", float64(sum)),
        formatter.FormatResult("subtraction", float64(difference)),
        formatter.FormatResult("multiplication", float64(product)),
        formatter.FormatResult("power", squared),
        formatter.FormatResult("square root", squareRoot),
        formatter.FormatResult("absolute value", absValue),
    }
    
    fmt.Println(formatter.FormatResults(results))
    
    // Cannot access unexported names:
    // isNeg := advanced.isNegative(-5)  // Error: unexported function
    // mult := basic.multiply(3, 4)      // Error: unexported function
}
```

### Building and Running

To build and run this multi-package application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Expected output:
```
CALCULATOR RESULTS

Result of addition: 8.00
Result of subtraction: 6.00
Result of multiplication: 42.00
Result of power: 16.00
Result of square root: 4.00
Result of absolute value: 42.00
```

This example demonstrates:
- Creating and organizing multiple packages
- Using exported and unexported functions
- Importing local packages
- Structuring a more complex application

All this is accomplished without using structs or function receivers, making it more appropriate for this stage of learning Go.

## Working with Artifactory for Go Packages

For our on prem environment, you will need to work with private package repositories like JFrog Artifactory.
This allows us to host and manage our own Go modules securely.

### Configuring Go to Use Artifactory

To use Artifactory as a Go proxy, you need to configure the `GOPROXY` environment variable:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Artifactory URL
export GOPROXY=https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/go/go-virtual
```

You can add this to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to make it permanent.

### Publishing a Go Module to Artifactory

<Warning>
This section requires revision (TBD)
</Warning>

To publish your Go module to Artifactory:

1. Make sure your module is properly tagged with a version:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

2. Build and test your module:

```bash
go build ./...
# this runs unit tests (like pytest)
# we will learn about testing in a future chapter
go test ./...
```

3. Push the module to Artifactory (assuming your module is already in a Git repository):

```bash
# First, configure Git for the Artifactory provider
git config --global url."https://your-username:your-api-key@artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/go/go-virtual".insteadOf "https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/go/go-virtual"

# Then push the module
GOPROXY=https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/go/go-virtual go list -m yourmodule@v1.0.0
```

### Consuming a Module from Artifactory

Once your module is published to Artifactory, others in your organization can consume it by setting their `GOPROXY` environment variable and then using `go get`:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/api/go/go-virtual
go get yourmodule@v1.0.0
```

The module will be downloaded from Artifactory rather than the public Go module proxy.

## Summary

In this chapter, we've covered:

- How packages work in Go and the naming conventions
- Creating and organizing your code into multiple packages
- Exported versus unexported names (public vs private)
- Importing and using local packages
- Adding and using third-party packages from GitHub
- Working with private package repositories in Artifactory

Understanding packages is crucial for building well-structured Go applications. With this knowledge, you can now organize your code more effectively and leverage the rich ecosystem of Go packages available.

In the next chapter, we'll explore flow control in Go, including if statements, loops, and switches.
