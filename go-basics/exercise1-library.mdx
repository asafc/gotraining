title: "Exercise 1: Library Book Management System"
---

## Description

You've been hired as a developer for the Gopher City Library.
The library needs a new system to manage their book inventory and track borrowing activity.
Your task is to create a command-line book management system that allows librarians to add books, check books in and out, and generate reports.

## Requirements

1. Create a program that manages a library of books with the following functionality:
   - Add new books to the inventory
   - Check out books to patrons
   - Return books to the inventory
   - List all books
   - Search for books by title or author
   - Generate a report of overdue books

2. Implement the following data structures:
   - A `Book` struct with fields for title, author, ISBN, and publication year
   - A `Patron` struct with fields for name, ID, and contact information
   - A `Transaction` struct that records check-outs and returns

3. Implement interfaces for:
   - `Searchable` - anything that can be searched
   - `Reporter` - anything that can generate reports

4. Use proper error handling throughout the application

5. Write at least one test function to verify functionality

## Expected Output

- Interactive command-line interface
- Ability to add, check out, return, and list books
- Search functionality
- Basic reporting

## Tips

- Start by defining your data structures
- Use pointers when you need to modify values
- Consider how interfaces can help organize your code
- Use the `fmt` package for user interaction
- Use maps to store your book and patron data
- To implement a CLI tool, use the [cobra library](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
