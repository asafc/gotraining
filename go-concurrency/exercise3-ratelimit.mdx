title: "Exercise 3: Rate Limiter"
---

## Problem Statement

In this exercise, you will implement an API rate limiter using Go's `time.Ticker`. Rate limiting is a critical technique used in API design to control the number of requests a client can make within a specified time period.

### Requirements:

1. Create a rate limiter that allows a maximum of N requests per second.
2. Implement a simulated API server that uses this rate limiter.
3. The server should:
   - Accept incoming requests
   - Apply rate limiting
   - Process valid requests 
   - Reject requests that exceed the rate limit
4. Use `time.Ticker` to manage the token bucket replenishment.
5. Demonstrate the rate limiter with concurrent client requests.

### Expected Behavior:

- Requests within the rate limit should be processed normally.
- Requests exceeding the rate limit should be rejected with a "Rate limit exceeded" message.
- The rate limiter should properly distribute allowed requests across the time window.

### Tips:

- Consider using a token bucket algorithm where tokens are replenished at a steady rate.
- Use channels to handle concurrent requests.
- Test your implementation with both normal and burst traffic patterns.

## Challenge Extension (Optional):

Extend your solution to include:
- Different rate limits for different API endpoints
- A burst capacity that allows temporary exceeding of the rate limit
- Request queuing when rate limit is exceeded (instead of immediate rejection)
