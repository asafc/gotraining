title: Wait Groups
---

In the previous chapter, we introduced goroutines as Go's way of handling concurrent execution. However, we encountered a problem: the main function might finish before our goroutines complete their work. We need a way to wait for all goroutines to finish before the program exits.

## The Problem with Basic Goroutines

Let's remind ourselves of the issue:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(id int) {
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)
	time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulate work
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		go worker(i)
	}
	
	// The program might exit before workers finish
	fmt.Println("All workers started")
}
```

If you run this program, you might not see all the "Worker done" messages because the main function exits before the goroutines complete.

## Enter sync.WaitGroup

The `sync.WaitGroup` type provides a simple yet powerful way to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish. A WaitGroup maintains a counter that tracks active goroutines. When you start a goroutine, increment the counter. When a goroutine completes, decrement the counter. The main function can wait until the counter reaches zero.

Here's how to use it:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	// Decrement counter when the function completes
	defer wg.Done()
	
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)
	time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulate work
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		// Increment counter for each goroutine
		wg.Add(1)
		go worker(i, &wg)
	}
	
	// Wait for all goroutines to finish
	wg.Wait()
	
	fmt.Println("All workers completed")
}
```

## How WaitGroup Works

The `sync.WaitGroup` has three main methods:

1. `Add(delta int)` - Increases the counter by the specified value
2. `Done()` - Decreases the counter by 1 (equivalent to `Add(-1)`)
3. `Wait()` - Blocks until the counter becomes zero

A typical pattern is:
- Create a WaitGroup in the parent function
- Call `Add(1)` before starting each goroutine
- Pass the WaitGroup to each goroutine (by pointer)
- Have each goroutine call `Done()` when it finishes
- Call `Wait()` in the parent function to block until all goroutines complete

## Best Practices

### Use defer

Using `defer wg.Done()` at the beginning of your goroutine function ensures that the counter is decremented even if the function panics or returns early:

```go
func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	// rest of the function
}
```

### Add before starting goroutines

Always call `wg.Add()` before launching the goroutine, not inside it:

```go
// Good
wg.Add(1)
go worker(i, &wg)

// Bad - can lead to race conditions
go func() {
	wg.Add(1)
	worker(i, &wg)
}()
```

### Pass WaitGroup by pointer

A WaitGroup must be passed by pointer to ensure all goroutines are operating on the same counter:

```go
go worker(i, &wg) // Not wg
```

## Practical Example: Parallel File Processing

Let's create a program that processes multiple files in parallel:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// processFile simulates processing a file
func processFile(filename string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	
	fmt.Printf("Processing file: %s\n", filename)
	// Simulate different processing times
	processingTime := time.Duration(len(filename) * 100) * time.Millisecond
	time.Sleep(processingTime)
	fmt.Printf("Finished processing: %s\n", filename)
}

func main() {
	files := []string{
		"document1.txt",
		"image.jpg",
		"spreadsheet.xlsx",
		"presentation.pptx",
	}
	
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	
	fmt.Println("Starting parallel file processing...")
	startTime := time.Now()
	
	for _, file := range files {
		wg.Add(1)
		go processFile(file, &wg)
	}
	
	// Wait for all files to be processed
	wg.Wait()
	
	elapsed := time.Since(startTime)
	fmt.Printf("All files processed in %s\n", elapsed)
}
```

This example demonstrates how WaitGroups allow us to process multiple items concurrently while still waiting for all operations to complete.

## Complete Working Example

Here's the complete, compilable code example for this chapter:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// processFile simulates processing a file
func processFile(filename string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	
	fmt.Printf("Processing file: %s\n", filename)
	// Simulate different processing times
	processingTime := time.Duration(len(filename) * 100) * time.Millisecond
	time.Sleep(processingTime)
	fmt.Printf("Finished processing: %s\n", filename)
}

func main() {
	files := []string{
		"document1.txt",
		"image.jpg",
		"spreadsheet.xlsx",
		"presentation.pptx",
	}
	
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	
	fmt.Println("Starting parallel file processing...")
	startTime := time.Now()
	
	for _, file := range files {
		wg.Add(1)
		go processFile(file, &wg)
	}
	
	// Wait for all files to be processed
	wg.Wait()
	
	elapsed := time.Since(startTime)
	fmt.Printf("All files processed in %s\n", elapsed)
}
```

## Summary

- `sync.WaitGroup` provides a mechanism to wait for multiple goroutines to complete
- Use `Add()` to increment the counter, `Done()` to decrement it, and `Wait()` to block until the counter reaches zero
- Always call `Add()` before starting the goroutine
- Use `defer wg.Done()` to ensure the counter is decremented even if the goroutine exits unexpectedly
- Pass WaitGroups by pointer to ensure all goroutines reference the same counter

In the next chapter, we'll look at another synchronization primitive from the sync package: Mutexes, which help us safely access shared resources from multiple goroutines.
