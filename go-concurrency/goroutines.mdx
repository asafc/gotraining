title: Go Routines and Channels
---

In this chapter, we'll explore one of Go's most powerful features: concurrency.

Go's concurrency model is based on goroutines and channels, which provide a simple yet effective way to write concurrent code.

## Goroutines

A goroutine is a **lightweight thread** managed by the Go runtime. Goroutines run in the same address space, so access to shared memory must be synchronized. Starting a goroutine is simple - just use the `go` keyword followed by a function call.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func say(s string) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
        fmt.Println(s)
    }
}

func main() {
    // Direct function call - runs synchronously
    say("Direct call")
    
    // Using go keyword to run in a new goroutine - runs asynchronously
    go say("goroutine")
    
    // This ensures the program doesn't exit before the goroutine completes
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}
```

When you run this program, you'll notice that "Direct call" is printed 5 times, followed by "goroutine" being printed. The direct call blocks the main function until it completes, while the goroutine runs concurrently.

However, using `time.Sleep()` to wait for goroutines to finish is not ideal. This brings us to channels.

## Channels

Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values. They provide a way for goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Create a new channel of type int
    ch := make(chan int)
    
    // Start a goroutine
    go func() {
        // Send a value to the channel
        ch <- 42
    }()
    
    // Receive a value from the channel
    value := <-ch // blocks until a value is available.
    fmt.Println(value)  // Prints: 42
}
```

In this example, the main function creates a channel, starts a goroutine that sends a value on the channel, and then receives that value. The receive operation `<-ch` blocks until a value is available.

By default, sends and receives block until the other side is ready. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.

## Buffered Channels

Channels can be buffered, meaning they can hold a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Create a buffered channel with capacity 2
    ch := make(chan int, 2)
    
    // These sends won't block because the buffer has room
    ch <- 1
    ch <- 2
    
    // Receive values
    fmt.Println(<-ch)  // Prints: 1
    fmt.Println(<-ch)  // Prints: 2
}
```

Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

If you try to send a value on a buffered channel that's already full, the send operation will block until space is available. Similarly, if you try to receive from an empty channel, the receive operation will block until a value is sent.

## Passing Messages Between Goroutines

Let's see a more practical example of passing messages between goroutines:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func sum(s []int, c chan int) {
    sum := 0
    for _, v := range s {
        sum += v
    }
    // Send sum to channel c
    c <- sum
}

func main() {
    s := []int{7, 2, 8, -9, 4, 0}
    
    // Create a channel
    c := make(chan int)
    
    // Split the slice in two and process each half concurrently
    go sum(s[:len(s)/2], c)
    go sum(s[len(s)/2:], c)
    
    // Receive from channel
    x, y := <-c, <-c
    
    fmt.Println(x, y, x+y)  // Output depends on which goroutine finishes first
}
```

In this example, we split a slice in half and compute the sum of each half concurrently. The results are sent back via a channel.

## Closing Channels

A sender can close a channel to indicate that no more values will be sent. Receivers can test whether a channel has been closed.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func fibonacci(n int, c chan int) {
    x, y := 0, 1
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        c <- x
        x, y = y, x+y
    }
    // Close the channel when done
    close(c)
}

func main() {
    c := make(chan int, 10)
    go fibonacci(10, c)
    
    // Method 1: Simple loop receiving until channel closes
    for i := range c {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
    
    // Method 2: Testing if channel is closed
    ch := make(chan int, 2)
    ch <- 1
    ch <- 2
    close(ch)
    
    v, ok := <-ch
    fmt.Println(v, ok)  // Prints: 1 true
    
    v, ok = <-ch
    fmt.Println(v, ok)  // Prints: 2 true
    
    v, ok = <-ch
    fmt.Println(v, ok)  // Prints: 0 false
}
```

When receiving from a closed channel:
1. The second value returned by the receive operation tells you whether the channel is still open.
2. The first value is the zero value of the channel's type if the channel is closed and empty.

## Range Over Channel

The `range` form of the for loop can be used to receive values from a channel until it is closed:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int, 5)
    
    // Send values
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        ch <- i
    }
    close(ch)
    
    // Receive values using range
    for n := range ch {
        fmt.Println(n)
    }
}
```

The loop receives values from the channel repeatedly until the channel is closed.

## Select Statement

The `select` statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations. It blocks until one of its cases can proceed, then it executes that case. If multiple cases are ready, it chooses one at random.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    c1 := make(chan string)
    c2 := make(chan string)
    
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        c1 <- "one"
    }()
    
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        c2 <- "two"
    }()
    
    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        select {
        case msg1 := <-c1:
            fmt.Println("received", msg1)
        case msg2 := <-c2:
            fmt.Println("received", msg2)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the first goroutine sends "one" after 1 second, and the second goroutine sends "two" after 2 seconds. The `select` statement in the main function will first receive "one" and then "two".

A `default` case in a `select` is run if no other case is ready:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    tick := time.Tick(100 * time.Millisecond)
    boom := time.After(500 * time.Millisecond)
    
    for {
        select {
        case <-tick:
            fmt.Println("tick.")
        case <-boom:
            fmt.Println("BOOM!")
            return
        default:
            fmt.Println("    .")
            time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
        }
    }
}
```

The `default` case prevents the `select` from blocking.
