title: "Exercise 2: Solution"

Here's a complete solution to the exercise:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// Simulated text files
var textFiles = []string{
    "Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.",
    "Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines.",
    "The language is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org.",
}

// WordCounter counts words in a text and sends the result to a channel
func wordCounter(id int, text string, resultChan chan<- int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    
    // Simulate processing time
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    
    words := strings.Fields(text)
    count := len(words)
    
    fmt.Printf("File %d has %d words\n", id, count)
    
    // Send result to channel
    resultChan <- count
}

func main() {
    start := time.Now()
    
    // Create a buffered channel to receive results
    resultChan := make(chan int, len(textFiles))
    
    // Use a WaitGroup to wait for all goroutines to finish
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    // Start a goroutine for each text file
    for i, text := range textFiles {
        wg.Add(1)
        go wordCounter(i, text, resultChan, &wg)
    }
    
    // Start a goroutine to close the result channel once all wordCounters are done
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(resultChan)
    }()
    
    // Collect and sum all results
    totalWords := 0
    for count := range resultChan {
        totalWords += count
    }
    
    elapsed := time.Since(start)
    fmt.Printf("Total words: %d\n", totalWords)
    fmt.Printf("Processing took %s\n", elapsed)
}
```

This solution demonstrates several important concurrency patterns:

1. Using goroutines to process multiple files in parallel
2. Using a channel to collect results from goroutines
3. Using a `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for all goroutines to complete
4. Closing a channel when all senders are done
5. Using `range` to receive all values from a channel until it's closed

When you run this program, you'll notice that the files are processed concurrently, and then the results are aggregated.
