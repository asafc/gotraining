title: "Exercise 2: Parallel Text Processing"
---

Now let's put your knowledge of goroutines, channels, and WaitGroups into practice with an exercise.

### Task
Create a program that processes a collection of text files in parallel. Your program should:

1. Count the number of words in each file concurrently using goroutines
2. Use channels to collect the results from each goroutine
3. Use a WaitGroup to ensure all processing completes
4. Print the total number of words across all files

### Starting code

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
    "time"
)

// Simulated text files
var textFiles = []string{
    "Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.",
    "Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines.",
    "The language is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org.",
}

// TODO: Implement a wordCounter function that counts words in a text and sends the result to a channel

func main() {
    start := time.Now()
    
    // TODO: Create necessary channels and WaitGroup
    
    // TODO: Launch goroutines to process each text file
    
    // TODO: Wait for all goroutines to complete and close the channel
    
    // TODO: Collect and sum all results
    
    elapsed := time.Since(start)
    // Print results and timing information
}
```

Try implementing this on your own before looking at the solution.
